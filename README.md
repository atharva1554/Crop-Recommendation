## Data

The dataset used in this project includes features like:
- Nitrogen content in soil
- Phosphorus content in soil
- Potassium content in soil
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

## Models

Various machine learning models were explored and evaluated, including:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model's performance was assessed based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Results

The results of the models, including their accuracy and other evaluation metrics, are documented in the `results/` directory. The project also includes visualizations and a detailed analysis of the model outcomes.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/atharva1554/Crop-Recommendation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Crop-Recommendation
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the project, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. These notebooks include data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. You can also use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory for specific tasks like data cleaning or model training.
